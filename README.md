# CMPG-323-Project-5-32681879
This is the final project of the semester where we will be focusing on reporting and monitoring

## Usage by stakeholders
- The stakeholders will be able to access the link of the report so that they can browse through the data .
- The user will be able to work with the filter by clicking on the category they want to filter according to and the data will filter accordingly.
- This whole project was implemented entirely on the Microsoft PowerBI.

## Project based on the task level.
- Create a repository named ‘CMPG323 Project 5 - <add your student number>’
- Create a ReadME.md file that will be used to describe your project and how stakeholders are to use the report that you have developed
- Ensure that the report has been committed and pushed to source control throughout the project
- Ensure that the GitHub project has been updated iteratively throughout project to demonstrate how progress was made
- Clone your GitHub repository
- Install Power BI Desktop
- Create a new Power BI Report named ‘Connected Office – Device Monitoring’
- Create a page named ‘High-Level Metrics’
- Create a page named ‘Device Monitoring’
- Create a page named ‘Device Registration’
- Create a live connection to the data sources that will be used as part of the visualisations to be created
- Ensure that the data connection is secure
- Ensure that the data sources are appropriately mapped, where necessary
- Ensure that the datasets are cleaned and all duplicates are removed
- Ensure that all imported data fields are associated to the correct data types
- Add a summary view that shows business stakeholders a high-level view of the ‘important’ data. This generally would refer to counts of data points based on  information that could impact decision making.
- Create a visual that allows the user to monitor devices per category
- Create a visual that allows the user to monitor devices per zone
- Create a visual that allows the user to monitor online versus offline devices (status should depict whether a device is online or offline)
- Create a visual that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan
- Create a visual that allows the user to see how many categories of devices have been created
- Create a visual that allows the user to see how many zones contain registered devices on a timeline
- Make use of filters that can be applied across pages and visuals
- Add a filter for users to filter the report based on device category
- Add a filter for users to filter the report based on device platform
- Add a filter for users to filter the report based on device zone
- Add a filter for users to filter the report based on device registration date
- Ensure that the ReadMe.md file in the GitHub repository explains how the user would use the report
- Create a reference list document that contains all sites visited and used to complete the project
